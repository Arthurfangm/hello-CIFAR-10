Technology like Xavier(Init method) weight decay, batch normalizationï¼Œ dropout(to avoid overfitting) and [factional max-pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6071)(alternative for 2x2 max-pooling) are involved in this implementatoin.

## Introduction
This is an implementatoin of deep neural network for the image classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset. [CIFAR-10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is a super important dataset in image classificatoin,
